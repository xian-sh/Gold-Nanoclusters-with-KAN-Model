## Workflow

A machine learning model using interpretable automated feature engineering (Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks) identifies charge number and Au-Au coordination as key structural descriptors, enabling accurate prediction of gold nanoclusters' electronic properties (HOMO, LUMO, gap, oxidation potential) with low error, offering a cost-efficient strategy for catalytic design.
